# Automating-Service-Provisioning-with-EPNM-API

This project has been developed to show the Northbound API capability of Cisco’s Evolved Network Programmable Manager (EPNM). EPNM has a good set of REST APIs and RESTConf APIs to achieve several tasks through third party interfaces (scripts, tools, etc.). This project focuses on bulk service provisioning task across the network using EPNM’s RESTConf API. 

The platform primarility we have choose here is Cisco's NCS4200 for TMD service provisioning. 
Later, we also included EPL service provisioning (as an additional example) with Cisco IOS-XR routers (NCS5500 and ASR9K).
This will give a positive mindset to users that this concept can be applied to various Cisco platforms supported in EPNM.
