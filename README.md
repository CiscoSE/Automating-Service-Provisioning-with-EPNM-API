This project has been developed to show the Northbound API capability of Cisco’s Evolved Network Programmable Manager (EPNM). EPNM has a good set of REST APIs and RESTConf APIs to achieve several tasks through third party interfaces (scripts, tools, etc.). This project focuses on bulk service provisioning task across the network using EPNM’s RESTConf API. 

The primary platform we have chosen for this project is Cisco's NCS4200 Platform for TDM service provisioning. 
Later, we also have included EPL service provisioning with minimum required options as an additional example for Cisco IOS-XR routers (NCS5500 and NCS9K). 
This has been done to provide positive mindset to the users the concept of the project can be utilized at various network platforms supported in EPNM.
